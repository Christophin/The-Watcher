# Firebase

_TODO expand these docs_

## Firestore

[Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/) is the realtime database that holds all of our data. It's built for speed and data sync.

## Functions

[Firebase functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/) are used to update the database with async tasks. We use functions to seperate some of the logic from the ui.
